        Where there's a will, there's a way, kind of beautiful
        And every night has its day, so magical
        And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
        That can't be defeated

        For every tyrant, a tear for the vulnerable
        In every lost soul, the bones of a miracle
        For every dreamer, a dream, we're unstoppable
        With something to believe in

        Monday left me broken
        Tuesday, I was through with hoping
        Wednesday, my empty arms were open
        Thursday, waiting for love, waiting for love

        Thank the stars, it's Friday
        I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
        Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
        I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love to come around

        We are one of a kind, irreplaceable
        How did I get so blind and so cynical?
        If there's love in this life, we're unstoppable
        No, we can't be defeated

        Monday left me broken
        Tuesday, I was through with hoping
        Wednesday, my empty arms were open
        Thursday, waiting for love, waiting for love

        Thank the stars, it's Friday
        I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
        Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
        I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love to come around
